# Real-Time 3D Mesh Similarity Search

Fun project! Got an idea to develop mesh search engine and decided to develop this project as and when I get the time.

I'm aiming to build a complex model search system using deep learning, with support for running efficiently across different hardware platforms.

Find similar 3D models in real time! This project lets you search for 3D meshes that look alike using geometry, deep learning, or both. It's great for CAD Designs, games, AR/VR, or any app where shape matters.


## What This Project Does

You give it a 3D mesh (like an OBJ, STL, or PLY file), and it quickly finds the most similar meshes from a database. It works fast—even with a big collection—by using smart indexing and optimized search.

## Features

- Supports traditional and deep learning-based features
- per fast search using FAISS or Annoy
- Preprocessing tools to clean, triangulate and normalize your meshes
- Tools to measure search quality (like accuracy and recall)
- Works on both macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon) and Linux
